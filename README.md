# Q-Table Learning in OpenAI Gym 

Overview
========
Q-Learning is one of the Reinforcement Learning Algorithm. In this tutorial we are going to use the OpenAI Gym "FrozenLake" environment. We are going to deploy the variant of Q-Learning called Q-Table learning algorithm which uses tables for mapping state space to action space.

You can find an excellent tutorial on Q-Table learning by Arthur Juliani [here](https://medium.com/emergent-future/simple-reinforcement-learning-with-tensorflow-part-0-q-learning-with-tables-and-neural-networks-d195264329d0).

Dependencies 
============
* Jupyter Notebook
* Numpy
* OpenAI Gym (https://gym.openai.com/docs/)

Credits
============
Most of the conceptual and programmatic understanding is borrowed from the Reinforcement Learning Series by Arthur Juliani [here](https://medium.com/emergent-future/simple-reinforcement-learning-with-tensorflow-part-0-q-learning-with-tables-and-neural-networks-d195264329d0).
